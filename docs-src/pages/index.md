title: SyncMedia Community Group Overview
---
This is an overview of work being done by the [Synchronized Media for Publications Community Group](#about-this-group). 

* [Github repository](https://github.com/w3c/sync-media-pub)
* [Mailing list archives](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sync-media-pub/)


## Latest work: SyncMediaLite

* Uses the browser's inbuilt cue synchronization capabilities via WebVTT
* Easy to implement a synchronized text highlight
* Works well for common use cases of audio narrated HTML documents

### Documents

* [Explainer](explainer)
* [Use cases](use-cases)
* [Draft spec](sync-media-lite)
* Demos:
  * [Accessible Books in Browsers](https://daisy.github.io/accessible-books-in-browsers/#demos): 
  _Self-playing text and audio books. The books here are converted automatically from DAISY 2.02/EPUB into multi-chapter sets of HTML files with built-in playback for SyncMediaLite_
  * [The Raven](https://raven-highlight-demo.netlify.app/)
  _Poem with multi-level highlighting. This is a single-page document with built-in playback for SyncMediaLite and advanced highlighting features_
  * [Using TextTrackCues to play EPUB Media Overlays](https://marisademeglio.github.io/mo-player/)
  _Using the same techniques as SyncMediaLite playback, this Media Overlays `.smil` file can be played_
  <!-- * [The World's Best Audiobook](https://github.com/marisademeglio/worlds-best-audiobook/tree/webvtt-experiment)
  _Enhanced W3C Audiobooks demo. This is more of a traditional "player" where the book documents are loaded into an `iframe`. The books are W3C Audiobooks with SyncMediaLite incorporated._

* Try this experimental tool to [convert Media Overlays to SyncMediaLite](convert-smil)

See [other work](https://github.com/w3c/sync-media-pub/tree/main/other-work) for more ideas this group has had over the years, including experiments with SMIL, and a syntactically-light JSON format. 

## About this group

### History
The [Synchronized Media for Publications Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/) was formed to recommend the best way to synchronize media with document formats that were being developed by the
Publishing Working Group, in order to make publications accessible to people with different types of reading requirements.

### Present
The [Publishing Maintenance Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pm/) is now primarily focused on spec maintenance; however, the work here continues to be to explore and develop synchronization techniques compatible with publishing formats on the web, including [Audiobooks](https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/), [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/), and standalone [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/).
