# Synchronized Multimedia for Publications

This is the repository for ongoing work initiated by the [W3C Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/), and
then transferred to the [Publication Maintenance Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pm/) for further
incubation.

The goal is to explore and develop media synchronization techniques compatible with publishing formats on the web,
including [Audiobooks](https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/), [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/), and standalone [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/).
