# Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group

This is the repository for ongoing work done by the [W3C Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/).

The task of the CG is to explore and develop media synchronization techniques compatible with publishing formats on the web, including [Audiobooks](https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/), [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/), and standalone [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/).
